# moondream

a tiny vision language model

## project goals

Build a high-quality, low-hallucination vision language model small enough to
run on an edge device without a GPU.

Initial prototype built using SigLIP, Phi-1.5, and the LLaVa training dataset.
The model is for research purposes only, and is subject to the Phi and LLaVa
license restrictions.
